\begin{abstract} This paper gives an introduction to numerical quadrature. 
Besides common approaches such as the Midpoint rule, Simpson's rules and 
Gaussian quadrature an overview of the routines, included in 
numerical libraries, is given. The GNU Scientific Library and the NAG 
Numerical Library are considered as representative for this purpose. 
\smallskip
The aim of this work is to give an overall introduction and 
thus to be a central entry point when considering numerical integration.
